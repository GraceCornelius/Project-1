        <p style="color:#DC143C">Hi Everyone! This is my first webpage that I made from scratch.<br>
        I am excited to learn more about web design so I can make my own website for my art.</p>
        <p style="color:#800000">So far I am enjoying the colors I can make the texts.<br>
        This is a really fun class so far and I hope I can keep learning and apply these new skills<br>
    to my future endeavors. Please enjoy this simple bat pic I found! Can't wait to learn what's next!</p>
